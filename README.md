# Enhanced-Stack-Data-Structure-for-Real-Time-Minimum-Element-Tracking
The Enhanced Stack Data Structure enables efficient push, pop, and top operations while maintaining real-time tracking of the minimum element in constant O(1) time. By using an auxiliary stack or optimized logic, it supports fast retrieval of the minimum without scanning, making it ideal for high-performance applications
